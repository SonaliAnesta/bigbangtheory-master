First, run the sheldon1 file using chmod +x sheldon1 command and ./sheldon1 command. Then open it using gdb.
 
Look for the functions inside sheldon1 using the command “info functions”. As we can see there are separate functions for each phase there.
 

 
Then view the assembly code of the main function using disassemble main command. 
  
View the assembly code of the phase_1 using disassemble phase_1 command.
 


In the first phase, there’s a simple string comparison in place. Very straight-forward. The first string being compared is our input. The second string is the password for phase_1.
 
Password for phase 01: Public speaking is very easy.
